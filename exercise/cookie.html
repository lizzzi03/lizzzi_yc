 <h3><strong>PREP TIME</strong></h3>

 <h3><strong>COOKING TIME</strong></h3>
 20 minutes plus at least 24 hours' chilling time

 <h3><strong>SKILL LEVEL</strong></h3>
 Easy

 <h3><strong>YIELD</strong></h3>
 2 dozen 3-inch cookies

 <h3><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour</li>
  <li>1 2/3 cups bread flour</li>
  <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</li>
  <li>2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups light brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
  <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h3>
<ol>
        <li>Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.</li>

  <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
 
        <li>Beat in the vanilla.</li>

        <li>Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.</li>

        <li>Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.</li>

        <li>Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.</li>

        <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.</li>

        <li>Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.</li>

        <li>Eat warm, with a glass of milk.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>EXPERT TIPS</strong></h3>

 The secret to richer Chocolate Chip Cookies with a more sophisticated flavor is letting the dough rest for 24 to 36 hours before baking.
